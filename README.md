## Hi there,
My name is Paul I am a radio amateur callsign PA0PHH. I got my license in 1981 and at the same time got bitten by the personal computer bug.
I started development on a RCA 1802 MCU, Atari ST, Windows PC and later on LINUX in C, C++, Java etc.
I love to develop software for raspberry pi using LVGL GUI library.
In my professional live I work for a large telecom software vendor helping telco's to mananage their telco network. 

My main project is sdrberry a raspberry pi sdr tranceiver, capable to manage SoapySDR SDR devices. 
You can check it out on youtube. https://youtu.be/ycU_IUmV8j4


73,
Paul
